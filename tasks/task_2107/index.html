    <h1>Birds and animals in bootstrap</h1>
    <p>
      Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves,
      characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of
      hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a
      strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size
      from the 5.5 cm bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m ostrich. There are about ten
      thousand living species. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due
      to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then.
      Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction.

      Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom
      Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe
      oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an
      ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of
      cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living
      animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are
      insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species
      in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres to 33.6 metres.
